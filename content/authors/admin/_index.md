I specialize in information security and software engineering. As such, I like to work on interesting problems that improve my life and as well as others that may not be able to ﬁx themselves. One such interesting problem that I worked on is making my power-wheelchair semi autonomous. This little project seemed insigniﬁcant at the time, but it turned out to have far-reaching possibilities in technology. This helped me to ﬁnd that I have a passion and a desire to help secure medical devices.

The research opened many doors for me in multiple areas like information security, medical device hacking, and help me to earn presenting spots in globally recognized conferences. Before graduating from university, my project was turned into an open sourced framework to work with a closed and proprietary protocol R-Net that earned international recognition.
