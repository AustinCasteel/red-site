Description: The Naomi Project is an open source, technology agnostic platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications!

Naomi software integrates different home text-to-speech & speech-to-text systems, plugins and technologies into a single solution. It provides uniform user interfaces, and a common approach for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications, regardless of the number of devices and sub-systems involved.
