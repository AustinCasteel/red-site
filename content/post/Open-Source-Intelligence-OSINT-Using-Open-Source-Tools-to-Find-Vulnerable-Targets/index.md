The Internet is an ocean of data which is an advantage as well as a disadvantage. Pros are that the internet is free and accessible to everyone unless restricted by an organization or law. The Internet has all the information readily available for anyone to access. Cons are that the information is available that can be misused by someone with a malicious intent, or in the case of infosec researchers fixing holes. We as researchers need to know what network resources are available for assessments.

Stephen will show how to use such tools to search and identify vulnerable real-world targets.
