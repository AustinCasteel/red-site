  description = "Power-wheelchairs could potentially infect anything in their path, leading to global fear that any device can be hacked and be used against anyone. Chairs are excellent malware vectors because they have Bluetooth which allows to attack nearby devices. Crafty internet access can be achieved using 6LoWPAN, so one can download new exploits to the chairâ€™s memory. Then use those exploits against any kind of Bluetooth-enabled device. Chairs are recent IoT devices and they can hide exploits in plain sight. Presented possible ways to implement malware in chairs."

I showed how easy it was to inject standard CAN messages to take full control of chairs with R-Net electronics. I provided some basic open source tools to allow people to customize their chairs more easily."
